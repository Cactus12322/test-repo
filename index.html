        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Sarah, and I like monkeys.</p>

        <p>Why I think roller coaster engineering is cool: I think it is cool because you are making things that people will enjoy and remember, and you can design it and be creating while doing it.</p>

        <p>Why I think coding is cool: I think it's cool beacause from google to this website you are reading, all of it was coded by someone, and it's pretty amazing to think about all of the people who have contributed to the internet's website's, search-engines, etc.</p>
